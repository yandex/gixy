# Overview
<img align="right" width="192" height="192" src="/docs/logo.png">

Gixy is a tool to analyze Nginx configuration.
The main goal of Gixy is to prevent security misconfiguration and automate flaw detection.

Currently supported Python versions are 2.7 and 3.5+.

Disclaimer: Gixy is well tested only on GNU/Linux, other OSs may have some issues.

# What it can do
Right now Gixy can find:
  * [[ssrf] Server Side Request Forgery](https://github.com/yandex/gixy/blob/master/docs/en/plugins/ssrf.md)
  * [[http_splitting] HTTP Splitting](https://github.com/yandex/gixy/blob/master/docs/en/plugins/httpsplitting.md)
  * [[origins] Problems with referrer/origin validation](https://github.com/yandex/gixy/blob/master/docs/en/plugins/origins.md)
  * [[add_header_redefinition] Redefining of response headers by  "add_header" directive](https://github.com/yandex/gixy/blob/master/docs/en/plugins/addheaderredefinition.md)
  * [[host_spoofing] Request's Host header forgery](https://github.com/yandex/gixy/blob/master/docs/en/plugins/hostspoofing.md)
  * [[valid_referers] none in valid_referers](https://github.com/yandex/gixy/blob/master/docs/en/plugins/validreferers.md)
  * [[add_header_multiline] Multiline response headers](https://github.com/yandex/gixy/blob/master/docs/en/plugins/addheadermultiline.md)

You can find things that Gixy is learning to detect at [Issues labeled with "new plugin"](https://github.com/yandex/gixy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+plugin%22)

# Installation
Gixy is distributed on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gixy). The best way to install it is with pip:
```bash
pip install gixy
```

Run Gixy and check results:
```bash
gixy
```

# Usage
By default Gixy will try to analyze Nginx configuration placed in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.

But you can always specify needed path:
```
$ gixy /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

==================== Results ===================

Problem: [http_splitting] Possible HTTP-Splitting vulnerability.
Description: Using variables that can contain "\n" may lead to http injection.
Additional info: https://github.com/yandex/gixy/blob/master/docs/ru/plugins/httpsplitting.md
Reason: At least variable "$action" can contain "\n"
Pseudo config:
include /etc/nginx/sites/default.conf;

	server {

		location ~ /v1/((?<action>[^.]*)\.json)?$ {
			add_header X-Action $action;
		}
	}


==================== Summary ===================
Total issues:
    Unspecified: 0
    Low: 0
    Medium: 0
    High: 1
```

Or skip some tests:
```
$ gixy --skips http_splitting /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

==================== Results ===================
No issues found.

==================== Summary ===================
Total issues:
    Unspecified: 0
    Low: 0
    Medium: 0
    High: 0
```

Or something else, you can find all other `gixy` arguments with the help command: `gixy --help`

## Docker usage

Gixy is available as a Docker image [from the Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/yandex/gixy/). To
use it, mount the configuration that you want to analyse as a volume and provide the path to the
configuration file when running the Gixy image.
```
$ docker run --rm -v `pwd`/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf/nginx.conf yandex/gixy /etc/nginx/conf/nginx.conf
```

If you have an image that already contains your nginx configuration, you can share the configuration
with the Gixy container as a volume.
```
$  docker run --rm --name nginx -d -v /etc/nginx
nginx:alpinef68f2833e986ae69c0a5375f9980dc7a70684a6c233a9535c2a837189f14e905

$  docker run --rm --volumes-from nginx yandex/gixy /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

==================== Results ===================
No issues found.

==================== Summary ===================
Total issues:
    Unspecified: 0
