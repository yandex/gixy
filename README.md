# Overview
Gixy is a tool for Nginx configuration analyzing. The main goal of Gixy is to prevent misconfiguration and automate flaw detection.
Currently supported Python versions is 2.7 and 3.4+.

Disclaimer: Gixy is well tested only on GNU/Linux, in other OS may have some issues.

# Installation
Gixy is distributed on PyPI. The best way to install it is with pip:
```bash
pip install gixy
```

Run Gixy and check results:
```bash

But you always can specify needed path:
```
$ gixy /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
